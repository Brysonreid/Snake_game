# Snake_game
This was a project I worked on in my first intro to computer science class, we were learning Python and the final project was a game.
I decided to use Pygame to create a multiplayer version of the classic snake game.
Looking at the project now years later there are many spots for improvement but this project reminds me of the thrill that I first had when learning of all the different
things that could be done with coding.
